# Water Mapping App

A [Google Earth Engine App](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) that delineates water bodies around the globe from 1984 until present and provides monthly estimates of surface area of water bodies as well as shapefiles to the user.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
